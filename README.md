# SQIR

![Logo](logo.png)

SQIR is a **S**mall **Q**uantum **I**ntermediate **R**epresentation for quantum programs. Its intended use is as an intermediate representation in a **V**erified **O**ptimizer for **Q**uantum **C**ircuits (VOQC), but we have also used it to implement verified versions of several quanutm algorithms.

We describe SQIR and its use in VOQC in our paper [A Verified Optimizer for Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02250), presented at POPL 2021. We describe the details of verifying SQIR programs in our paper [Proving Quantum Programs Correct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01240), presented at ITP 2021. The code corresponding to both papers can be found in the [POPL2021 branch](https://github.com/inQWIRE/SQIR/tree/POPL2021) of this respository. Preliminary versions of this work were presented at QPL 2019 and PLanQC 2020, and follow-on work was presented at PLanQC 2021.

This repository contains our Coq formalization of SQIR and VOQC as well as several verified quantum algorithms. If you are interested in *running the VOQC compiler*, then you should look at our OCaml library ([inQWIRE/mlvoqc](https://github.com/inQWIRE/mlvoqc)) or Python library ([inQWIRE/pyvoqc](https://github.com/inQWIRE/pyvoqc)) instead. The OCaml library is extracted from our Coq definitions and the Python library is a wrapper around the OCaml library.

If you are interested in learning more about formal verification of quantum programs in general, we recommend Robert Rand's [Verified Quantum Computing tutorial](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~rrand/vqc/index.html).

## Setup

To compile SQIR and VOQC, you will need [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) and the [Coq Interval package](http://coq-interval.gforge.inria.fr/). We strongly recommend using [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) to install Coq and `opam switch` to manage Coq versions. We currently support Coq **versions 8.12-8.14**. If you run into errors when compiling our proofs, first check your version of Coq (`coqc -v`).

Assuming you have opam installed (following the instructions in the link above), follow the steps below to set up your environment.
```
# environment setup
opam init
eval $(opam env)

# install some version of the OCaml compiler in a switch named "voqc"
opam switch create voqc 4.12.0
eval $(opam env)

# install Coq -- this will take a while!
opam install coq

# install Interval package (optional, needed to compile proofs in examples/shor)
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam update
opam install coq-interval
```

**TODO: add notes about installing QuantumLib**

*Notes*:
* Depending on your system, you may need to replace 4.12.0 in the instructions above with something like "ocaml-base-compiler.4.12.0". Any recent version of OCaml should be fine.
* We require Coq version >= 8.12. We have tested compilation with 8.12, 8.13, and 8.14.
* opam error messages and warnings are typically informative, so if you run into trouble then make sure you read the console output.

## Compilation

Run `make` to compile the core files of SQIR, `make voqc` to compile proofs about VOQC, `make examples` to compile proofs of correctness for example quantum algorithms (excluding those in examples/shor), and `make shor` to compile proofs about Shor's algorithm. Use `make all` to compile everything. 

Our proofs are resource intensive so expect `make all` to take a little while. If you have cores to spare, then you can speed things up by compiling with the `-j` flag (e.g. `make all -j8`). On a 2015 dual-core MacBook Pro running Coq version 8.14.0 compilation takes around 30 minutes.

## Directory Contents

### SQIR

Definition of the SQIR language.

- DensitySem.v : Density matrix semantics for general SQIR programs.
- Equivalences.v : Verified circuit equivalences for peephole optimizations.
- NDSem.v : Non-deterministic semantics for general SQIR programs.
- Run.v : 'run' function to describe running a quantum circuit and sampling from the output distribution.

We also rely on several files from the [QuantumLib](https://github.com/inQWIRE/QuantumLib) development, which we have linked as a git submodule in the externals directory.

### VOQC

Verified transformations of SQIR programs. The optimizations and mapping routines extracted to our OCaml library ([inQWIRE/mlvoqc](https://github.com/inQWIRE/mlvoqc)) are all listed in **Main.v**. So this file is a good starting point for getting familiar with VOQC.

The rest of the files in the VOQC directory can be split into the following categories:
