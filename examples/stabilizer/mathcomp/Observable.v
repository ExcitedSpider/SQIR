(* An operator is hermitian if it is self-adjoint   *)
Definition hermitian {n:nat} (H: Square (2^n)): Prop :=
  H† = H.

(* meas_to m M ψ captures the projective measurement postulate:
  if ψ is an eigenvector of Hermitian observable M with eigenvalue m, 
  then measuring M on ψ yields m with certainty (probability = 1). *)
Definition meas_to {n} (m: C) (M: Square (2^n)) (psi: Vector (2^n)) :=
  WF_Matrix M /\ hermitian M /\ M × psi = m .* psi.

(* 
  This section verifies the meas_to is consistent 
  with quantumlib measurement definition .
  Quantumlib only defines measurement in computational basis and if we 
  want to achieve verification, we neeed to map the state and result to 
  computational basis based on the observable.  

  Which i find very hard to do because:
  - it involves a lot of theories in linear algebra, which we don't have in quantumlib
  - the theory is non-trivial. 
  - i don't have much time
  - The projective measurement postulate itself can be considered as an axiom,
    i.e. it is more foundamental in theory.
  - Quantumlib does not have sparse measurement primitive.
    e.g. for 4 qubits, only measure the 2nd and the 4th 
      (related to observables like Z2Z4 )
  - And also, i find it is not our focus of research. 

  A better way of doing this is that, make a more fundamental definition of 
  measurement. 
  For example, we can have _Quantum Measurement Postulate_[1], and then use this
  definition to verify both measurements are correct, that is, they are be proved
  by the postulate.

  It will be more suitable to be considerred as a foundational change to quantumlib.
